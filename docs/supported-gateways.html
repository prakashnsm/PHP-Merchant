	<h3>Basic Operations</h3>
	<p>Supported operations of payment gateways can be categorized into 7 types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Purchase</strong>: to process a transaction. Authorization of fund transfer and capture is done simultaneously.</li>
		<li><strong>Authorize</strong>: to authorize a payment in advance. This is useful for delayed order fulfillment process.</li>
		<li><strong>Capture</strong>: to capture either a partial amount or the full authorization amount.</li>
		<li><strong>Void</strong>: to void a previous authorization.</li>
		<li><strong>Credit</strong>: to refund a customer for a transaction that was processed and successfully settled through the payment gateway.</li>
		<li><strong>Recurring</strong>: to make a recurring payment (e.g. monthly subscription).</li>
		<li><strong>Card Store</strong>: store the credit card (and/or other payment) information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>PHP Merchant provides an abstract API consistent with the above categorization, so that you won't have to worry about the deep technical details about how payment requests are made.</p>
