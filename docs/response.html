<p>When an operation is performed by a payment gateway, a response object is always returned. Note that each gateway might extend the base response class to provide additional functions.</p>

<p>The common API for gateway responses are described below. For additional response functions provided by individual gateways, you might need to check the gateway's documentation.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<h4 id="get"><code>get()</code></h4>
		<p>Returns a property of the response. Some payment gateways return the build version, or a special token ID in order to validate a payment. You'll need to refer to the gateway's documentation and use this <code>get()</code> function to retrieve the value of such properties.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h4 id="is_successful"><code>is_successful()</code></h4>
		<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the payment request is successfully sent, and the response from the payment gateway contains no errors.</p>
		<p>Note that this does not actually indicate the transaction status (whether the payment is successfully debited into the merchant account, or it is still pending). For that, you need to use <code>is_payment_completed().</code></p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h4 id="has_errors"><code>has_errors()</code></h4>
		<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the response from the payment gateway contains errors.</p>
		<p>To actually get the error details, use <a href="#get_errors"><code>get_errors()</code></a></p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h4 id="get_errors"><code>get_errors()</code></h4>
		<p>Returns an array containing errors. Each error is an array containing the following keys:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>code</code>: error code supplied by the payment gateway</li>
			<li><code>message</code>: error message</li>
			<li><code>details</code>: some payment gateways also supplied a "long error message" that is more verbose</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h4 id="get_response_string"><code>get_response_string()</code></h4>
		<p>Returns the raw response string from the payment gateway.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
