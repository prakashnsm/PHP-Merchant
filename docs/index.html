	<h3>What is PHP Merchant?</h3>
	<p>PHP Merchant is a PHP library that lets developers easily integrate multiple payment gateways into their PHP applications. This PHP library was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant/">active_merchant</a>, a payment abstraction library written in Ruby.</p>

	<h3>Why use PHP Merchant?</h3>
	<p>The goal of PHP Merchant is to provide a consistent API across various payment gateways, so that you won't have to deal with each gateway's quirks. For instance, with Paypal IPN, 'payment_status' could sometimes be 'Canceled_Reversal', but in Paypal Express Checkout, it's 'Canceled-Reversal'. These inconsistent details can be very confusing and it's hard to memorize them all. PHP Merchant helps by providing a consistent abstraction across all supported payment gateways to make your job faster and easier.</p>
	<p>With PHP Merchant, payment gateway API are categorized into 7 types of functionality:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Purchase</li>
		<li>Authorize</li>
		<li>Capture</li>
		<li>Void</li>
		<li>Credit</li>
		<li>Recurring</li>
		<li>Card Store</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There might be unique functionalities to some payment gateways that are also supported (for instance: Setup Purchase (SetExpressCheckout) for Paypal Express Checkout). There will be documentation for each payment gateway to point out those little details.</p>
