<p>PHP Merchant is developed and maintained by <a href="http://instinct.co.nz">Instinct Entertainment</a>. Some of the code was borrowed from and designed for our <a href="http://getshopped.org">WordPress e-Commerce Plugin project.</a></p>
<p>We're building a community around this project so that other developers can contribute code and ideas. See the page about <a href="contributing.html">Contributing</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Kudos to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant/">active_merchant</a> project for giving us inspiration to create this payment gateway library for the PHP community.</p>
<p>The thoroughness and outline of documentation is influenced by <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide">CodeIgniter's User Guide</a>. Of all PHP projects out there, CodeIgniter probably has one of the best documentations.</p>
<p>Other tools that we use to manage the project and documentation are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com">github</a>: awesome git hosting service.</li>
	<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>: manage and generate documentation using templates.</li>
</ul>
